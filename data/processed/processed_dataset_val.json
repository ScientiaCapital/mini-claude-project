      "output": "Here's a systematic approach to compare job offers:\n\n**1. Create a Comparison Matrix**\nList factors important to you, assign weights (1-10), then score each job:\n\n- Salary & compensation (consider total package)\n- Career growth opportunities\n- Work-life balance\n- Company culture & values alignment\n- Location & commute\n- Benefits (health, retirement, PTO)\n- Job security & company stability\n- Learning opportunities\n- Team & manager quality\n\n**2. Consider Your Life Stage**\n- Early career: Prioritize growth and learning\n- Mid-career: Balance growth with stability\n- Family considerations: Work-life balance becomes crucial\n\n**3. Future-Proof Your Decision**\n- Which role positions you better for your 5-year goals?\n- Which industry has better long-term prospects?\n- Consider skills you'll develop in each role\n\n**4. Trust Your Gut**\nAfter rational analysis, which opportunity excites you more?\n\n**5. Practical Steps**\n- Request detailed offer letters\n- Research company reviews on Glassdoor\n- Network with current/former employees\n- Negotiate if needed\n\nRemember: No choice is permanent, but choose the path that aligns best with your current priorities and future aspirations."

      "input": "What are the main causes of climate change?",
      "output": "The main causes of climate change are: 1) Greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas) for energy, 2) Deforestation which reduces CO2 absorption, 3) Industrial processes and manufacturing, 4) Transportation emissions from cars, planes, and ships, 5) Agriculture, particularly livestock farming which produces methane, 6) Land use changes that release stored carbon, and 7) Waste management issues. The primary driver is the increased concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, which traps heat and causes global warming."

      "output": "Here's a proven step-by-step approach to language learning:\n\n**Week 1-2: Foundation**\n1. Choose your target proficiency level and timeline\n2. Start with basic pronunciation and alphabet/writing system\n3. Learn the 100 most common words\n4. Download a language app (Duolingo, Babbel) for daily practice\n\n**Week 3-8: Building Blocks**\n5. Focus on essential grammar patterns\n6. Expand vocabulary to 1000 most common words\n7. Start listening to simple audio content (podcasts, music)\n8. Practice speaking with yourself in the mirror daily\n\n**Month 3-6: Active Use**\n9. Find a conversation partner (online or local)\n10. Consume native content (news, shows) with subtitles\n11. Start writing short paragraphs daily\n12. Join online communities in your target language\n\n**Ongoing: Immersion**\n13. Set your phone/computer to the target language\n14. Think in the new language for specific activities\n15. Visit countries where it's spoken if possible\n\nKey tip: Consistency beats intensity - 30 minutes daily is better than 3 hours once a week."

Here's the fixed version:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    if not numbers:  # Check if list is empty\n        return 0  # or raise ValueError(\"Cannot calculate average of empty list\")\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n```\n\nThis fix adds a guard clause to handle the empty list case gracefully."

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that specifically deals with algorithms that can learn and improve from data without being explicitly programmed. In essence, ML is one approach to achieving AI, where systems learn patterns from data to make predictions or decisions."

More descriptive function name\n2. Type hints for better code documentation\n3. Docstring explaining the function's purpose\n4. List comprehension for more Pythonic and efficient code\n5. Single line implementation that's easier to read and understand"
